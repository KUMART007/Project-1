STEP OUT

https://brocdavis.github.io/Project-1/

created by Code Force (Group members: Martin EyongNguta, Broc Davis, and Jennifer Gaumnitz)

* 3 User Stories for "Step Out!" app

   "As a user" I want to "search for events or activities happening today" so that I can "attend or participate in one of the events or activities."

   "As a user" I want to "know the temperature" so that "I can dress appropriately."

   "As a user" I want "the app to surprise me by choosing one of the retrieved activities" so that "I don't have to decide what I'm going to do for myself."


   In this assignment, we created an application that takes a user's ZIP code and a choice of range of miles and retrieves data from two APIs: Weather (at Weatherbit.io) and Eventful.com. The app then displays up-to-date information about 10 events or activities in that ZIP code and within the range of miles and also displays the current temperature for that same area. It also provides an option for the user to let the app randomly choose one of the 10 events.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

  The app fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught us to work with two new APIs. We also utilized Pure CSS Loader, SVG Backgrounds, Favicon & App Icon Generator, and HTML Color Codes in the creation of the project.


HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

   In the ZIP code entry field, enter a valid U.S. 5-digit ZIP code. Choose a range of miles to search in the dropdown menu. Click the "Submit" button. Navigate to the area below and choose one of the events and click on the link to open the event website to retrieve more information about the chosen event. Or you can click the "Surprise Me" button and the app will choose and display just one of the events.
